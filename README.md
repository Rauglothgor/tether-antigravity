# Get Shit Done (GSD) 2.0: Mission Control for AI

**The Enterprise-Grade Agentic OS for Google Antigravity.**

GSD 2.0 is a disciplined "Mission Control" layer that keeps AI agents focused, spec-driven, and context-aware. It moves beyond simple chat by enforcing professional engineering standards automatically.

## ⚡ The Philosophy: From "Chat" to "Build"
Standard AI coding is fast but fragile. Context degrades, the AI guesses, and projects become "hallucination soup." 

**GSD is the antidote.** It creates a "Command and Control" structure that ensures every line of code is backed by a specification, verified by a test, and logged for long-term memory.

## 🚀 The "Novice" Guide (How this works for you)

If you aren't a coder, think of GSD 2.0 as your **Self-Building Construction Crew**. You don't need to know how to lay bricks; you just need to describe the house.

### Core Concepts
* **The Blueprint (`/specify`)**: The AI turns your "Plain English" ideas into a professional technical plan before it starts building.
* **The Safety Inspector (`FAILURE_MODES.md`)**: The system brainstorms everything that could go wrong and builds "safety nets" to prevent crashes.
* **The Specialized Crew**: Instead of one AI, GSD uses "roles." An **Architect** designs, a **Coder** builds, and a **Reviewer** checks for mistakes.
* **The Crew's Diary (`GEMINI.md`)**: Every mistake is written down. The AI literally gets smarter the more you use it because it never makes the same mistake twice.

## 🗣️ Command Reference

### The "God Mode" Trigger
| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/godmode [goal]`** | **Full Autopilot**. The agent will design, build, test, self-correct, and document your entire request from start to finish without needing your help. |

### Operational Commands
| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/status`** | Shows project health, progress, and AI accuracy metrics. |
| **`/decision [topic]`** | Logs a major choice in `DECISIONS.md` so you know *why* the AI did something. |
| **`/blocker [msg]`** | Used by the AI to stop work and ask you for help if it hits an external wall. |
| **`/rollback`** | The "Panic Button." Instantly reverts the code to the last working version. |

## �️ Real-World Use Cases

### 1. The Small Business Inventory Tracker
* **User says**: `/godmode Create an app to track my shop inventory using barcode scanning.`
* **AI does**: Defines the rules, sets up the camera access, builds the database, and tests it in a virtual browser. If the scanner fails, it fixes the code itself until it works.

### 2. The Smart Home Dashboard
* **User says**: `/godmode Build a dashboard for my Proxmox server that shows CPU usage.`
* **AI does**: Researches your server settings, creates the visual charts, and ensures the data updates in real-time.

## 📂 The Archive & Memory
When a phase is finished, run **`/archive-phase`**. This compresses the "clutter" and saves the "lessons" into your long-term knowledge base, keeping your AI fast and sharp.
