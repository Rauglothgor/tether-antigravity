## Intent > Truth > Utility

This software is released under what I call the **RandOS Kernel**: *Intent over Truth over Utility*. That means:

1. **Intent**: I built this to solve a problem and share it with the world
2. **Truth**: It works (probably), but I'm not your lawyer, accountant, or therapist
3. **Utility**: Use it, break it, fix it, ship it - just don't be a dick about it

## The Actual Legal Stuff (Because Lawyers Exist)

**Permission is hereby granted, free of charge,** to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

### What You Must Do:

1. **Keep this notice around.** The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. **Give credit where it's due.** If you build something cool with this, a shoutout would be nice. Not required, but karma is real.

3. **Don't be a dick.** Specifically:
   - Don't claim you wrote this if you didn't
   - Don't weaponize this code to harm people
   - Don't sell it as-is and call it a day (add value, damn it)
   - Don't remove this license and pretend it never existed

### What I'm Telling You (The Warranty Disclaimer):

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS",** without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. 

**Translation**: This code probably works. I've tested it. But if it deletes your database, launches your production server into the sun, or causes your cat to judge you silently - that's on you. I accept zero liability for your choices.

**IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE** for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.

## Optional but Encouraged:

If this software made your life easier and we ever cross paths:
- Buy me a coffee ☕
- Contribute back to the project
- Tell someone else about it
- Or just send good vibes into the universe

## Why This License?

Because the MIT License works but reads like tax code. Because the WTFPL is funny but legally sketchy. Because life's too short for boring licenses, but also too short for lawsuits.

This is MIT-compatible, legally sound, and has personality. Use it. Fork it. Make it yours.

**Questions?** Fork off. (Kidding. Sort of. Reach out if you need to.)

## Technical Compliance Notes:

- **OSI-Compatible**: This license satisfies the Open Source Definition
- **GPL-Compatible**: Yes, you can combine this with GPL code
- **MIT-Derived**: Core legal framework is MIT License (OSI approved since 1998)
- **Warranty Disclaimer**: Covers implied warranties per UCC § 2-316
- **Limitation of Liability**: Protects against consequential damages claims

**SPDX Identifier**: `RandOS-1.0`

*Built by a Marine Corps veteran, artist, MBA, and city alderman who believes in shipping finished work. This license reflects that ethos.*

**Now get out there and build something.**
