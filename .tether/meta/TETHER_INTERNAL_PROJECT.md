# PROJECT.md - TETHER v2.0 Core Infrastructure

## North Star
To provide a disciplined, context-resilient, and autonomous "Enterprise Agentic OS" for AI development within the Google Antigravity environment.

## Project Pillars
1. **Disciplined Autonomy**: Orchestrating complex builds via `/godmode` without human micro-management.
2. **Persistent Learning**: Ensuring no mistake is made twice by leveraging `GEMINI.md` and `.tether/knowledge/`.
3. **Operational Transparency**: Mandatory auditing and quantified performance metrics (`STATE.json`).

## Tech Stack
- **Environment**: Google Antigravity (Agentic Mode)
- **Methodology**: TETHER 2.0 (Mission Control)
- **Tooling**: Git, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Windows PowerShell

## Architecture Overview
A flat root repository structure where core logic is defined in `.agent/workflows/` and state is managed in `.tether/`.
- **Primary Brain**: `00_ARCHITECT_BRAIN.md`
- **Audit Layer**: `.tether/AUDIT.md` 
- **Knowledge Core**: `.tether/knowledge/`
